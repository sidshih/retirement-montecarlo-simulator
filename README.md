# 📊 Retirement Monte Carlo Simulator

A Monte Carlo simulation tool for retirement planning with ETF portfolios.  
Built with **Python + Streamlit**, this app helps estimate withdrawal success rates, asset trajectories, and portfolio survival probabilities.  

👉 Live Demo: (your Streamlit link will go here once deployed)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Input **ETF tickers** (e.g., VTI, VXUS, BND) and set **portfolio weights**  
- Run **Monte Carlo simulations** with historical ETF return distributions  
- Compare two withdrawal strategies:
  - **Fixed spending (inflation-adjusted)**
  - **Percentage-based withdrawal (e.g., 4% rule)**
- Visual outputs:
  - **Success rate** (portfolio survives the retirement horizon)
  - **Final wealth distribution histogram**
  - **Sample wealth trajectories**
